      <h3>Here's a timeline of the Final Fantasy series:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1987:</strong> Square releases Final Fantasy on the NES console. The game was not intended as a series but had huge success. It is considered the most inluential RPG Nintendo has ever had.</li>
        <li><strong>1988:</strong> Final Fantasy II is launched for Famicom (A Japanese-only NES). The series introduces several key elements that define it up until today (e.g. Chocobos, Cid character, Leveling system) </li>
        <li><strong>1990:</strong> Final Fantasy III is launched for Famicom, again only in Japan. Introduces a job-change system. </li>
        <li><strong>1991:</strong> Final Fantasy IV is released for SNES on a global scale (for western audiences it is released as FF II). The game introduces the Active Time Battle‚Äù system (ATB), later found in most of the series' games.</li>
        <li><strong>1992:</strong> Final Fantasy V is released for Super Famicom, again only in Japan.</li>
        <li><strong>1994:</strong> Square releases Final Fantasy VI worldwide (as with all subsequent mainline FFs). The game takes place in an all new industrial-revolution-era world and is considered a major improvement of the series.  </li>
        <li><strong>1997:</strong> One of the most popular and outstanding additions to the series is launched for PlayStation 1, after Square breaks its collaboration with Nintendo. Final Fantasy 7 sets unprecedented standards for the RPG and the video game industry as a whole.</li>
        <li><strong>1999:</strong> Final Fantasy VIII is launched for PlayStation 1 with an epic story and improved graphics. For the first time a vocal piece is included as part of the game's soundtrack/</li>
        <li><strong>2000:</strong> Final Fantasy IX is released on PlayStation 1, with a fantasy world similar to the ones of the first games of the series. Many consider it as one of the best games of all time. </li>
        <li><strong>2001:</strong> Final Fantasy X is released on the Playstation 2 and makes a breakthrough with actual actors and voice over for all the main characters of the game.</li>
        <li><strong>2002:</strong> Square makes a huge leap as it releases Final Fantasy XI for PlayStation 2 and Windows, which is a fully onling RPG, the first MMORPG that supports cross-platform play. After 20 years, the game continues being online and supported by the company.</li>
        <li><strong>2006:</strong> Final Fantasy XII debuts for PlayStation 2, focusing on fluid battles and open exploration, since it takes place in an open world.</li>
        <li><strong>2009:</strong> Final Fantasy XIII debuted for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows. With another leap in graphics and a truly mythical world, the game focuses on fast paced battles and spectacular action.</li>
        <li><strong>2010:</strong> Final Fantasy XIV is launched as an online RPG for Windows. However the game seems unfinished and heads towards disaster. In 2013 Square Enix re-releases the game after a complete restructuring as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn for Windows, PlayStation3 and XBox 360. The game is considered as one of the best and most successful MMORPGs of all time.</li>
        <li><strong>2016:</strong> Final Fantasy XV is launched for PlayStation 4 and XBox One. The game features an action-based combat system where the player controls a character within a party of four. The game included several DLCs and an open world.</li>
        <li><strong>2020:</strong> Square Enix releases the first part of the Remake of Final Fantasy VII, a collection of three standalone games that will narrate a slightly more detailed version of the original, with several additions, contemporary graphics of the highest quality and a very rich battle system.</li>
        <li id='last'><strong>2023:</strong> The release of Final Fantasy XVI is planned. With another medieval-style world, the company returns to the roots of the series but changes radically the battle system, probably with the adoption of one character action battles, instead of a party, for the first time of the history of the single player FF titles.</li>
      </ul>
